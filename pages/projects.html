                <p class="has-text-black-bis">A project I worked on on my own with the goal of being able to predict the
                    outcome of pokemon battles from the website Pokemon Showdown. Pokemon as a game is unfathomably
                    complex, each player will enter a game with a team of 6 monsters, chosen out of the 1,015 possible.
                    If each player has 6 of these possible creatures and cannot repeat then, without even taking attacks
                    or abilities into consideration, then there are a possible 2.18 * 1035 states before a game
                    even begins. From there the game just gets more complex.

                <p class="has-text-black-bis">The program I wrote to challenge this problem was a terminal based python
                    program
                    that ended up working with about 60% accuracy. This is better than a coinfilp and is successful in
                    my eyes. Some work has been done to this project since I submitted it for a class in the spring of
                    2023.

                <p class="has-text-black-bis">This was a project I worked on in conjuction with an essay which explored
                    people's perception of large language models across many different communities. Originally this was
                    intended to interface with Twitter, but due ownership changes in the fall of 2022, Twitter had
                    restricted their api access. I shifted to working with Reddit and the various subreddits that would
                    have interesting and relavant opinions to what I was researching. However, due to Reddit's
                    API changes in the Summer of 2023, much of this code may be depricated and may no longer work.

                <p class="has-text-black-bis">Using the Reddit API I scraped posts from Reddit and ran them through a
                    sentiment analysis to get the general opinion of the user making the post. From there I took the
                    average sentiments of different communities in order to make generalizations about the opinions of
                    people in those communities.

                    This was a project I worked on in the Spring of 2023 for a class. The goal was to
                    create a program that could take a recipe from a website and convert it into a machine readable
                    format. This was done using a Python program that utilized webscrapping to get the recipe from the
                    website and then used a natural language processing library to convert the recipe into a machine or
                    robot readable format. The idea was to get instructions such as "preheat the oven to 350 degrees"
                    into a form that a robot could understand and execute. So using the example above, the program would
                    tell the robot to "heat oven".

                <p class="has-text-black-bis">I worked on this project with a handfull of other students in an Agile
                    format in order to deliver the end poduct described above to a client. In the end we made a viable
                    program that worked better than we had imagined. I learned valuable team work skills as well as
                    leadership skills within the context of a computer science enviornment while working on this
                    project.

                    my teammates before I upload the video to this website.

                            with a
                            class. The goal was to
                            program a robot to follow a wall utilizing a q-learning algorithm. The robot in question was
                            a
                            turtlebot 3 that was controlled using a Python program using the Robotics Operating System
                            (ROS).
                            The learning was done within a Gazebo simulation complete with a model of the robot and the
                            wall it
                            was to follow. The robot was able to learn to follow the wall with a decent amount of
                            success.

                            great learning experience. I learned a lot about the ROS system and how to program a robot
                            to learn
                            from its environment. I also learned a lot about the challenges of working with a physical
                            robot and
                            moving from a simulation to the real world.
